## ðŸ“„ Files Included

- **Data Leak Worksheet.docx**  
  Based on a simulated data breach scenario, this worksheet required identifying the core issue(s), reviewing what led to the incident, and providing actionable security recommendations.

- **Home Asset Inventory.xlsx**  
  An asset management worksheet where I cataloged personal devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, networking hardware) and documented their network connections, ownership, physical location, sensitivity, and associated data risks.

- **Parking Lot USB Exercise.docx**  
  A scenario-based exercise analyzing the risks of a lost USB drive containing a mix of personally identifiable information (PII), sensitive personal information (SPII), and internal company documents. I approached this from an attacker's mindset, performed a risk analysis, and identified potential exploitation vectors.

- **PASTA Worksheet.docx**  
  A structured threat modeling worksheet based on the PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) framework. This included defining application goals, identifying technologies used, drafting a data flow diagram, conducting a threat and vulnerability analysis, building an attack tree, and performing a risk and impact assessment for a sneaker company's new app.
