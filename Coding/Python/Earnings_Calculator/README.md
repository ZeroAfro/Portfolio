A simple earnings calculator that will first ask for your employee name, then for your hourly wage and finally your hours worked to then calculate your earnings for
that current week.

The hourly wage and hours worked will be turned into floats and calculated into the total_earnings variable

It then takes these variables and uses them in a F-string to display the resaults with the earnings being formated to only show two decimals for better readability.
