Based on my number list generator. It will create a txt file in the directory the code is ran that will store title of anything you want so that you can keep a list of the books you are wanting to read (or anything else really).
It will place each new entry on a new line and fromat it with square brackets for better visability.

To-Do:
Add the ability to delete entries by their title
