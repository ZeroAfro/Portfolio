# **PORTFOLIO**
Here is where I store all of my various python related projects, I split them into into catagories for easier organization from small to large project sizes and/or grouped by specific tools used
such as Django or Tkinter.

Each project will contain a README explaining a bit behind the code and how to run it. As well as other tid bits of info I thought might be needed.
