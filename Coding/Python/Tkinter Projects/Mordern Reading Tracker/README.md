# **Modern Tkinter Reading Tracker**

This is the same as my 'regular' reading tracker however this uses ttk themed widgets to give at a more modern look. It provides a gui with an input field that will take
titles and once you hit 'ENTER' save it in a list, the ability to exit the application via hitting 'ESC', a button to open the text file itself, and a button to pull a random title out of the list and display it in the GUI.

It will also search the title before saving it in the list for common formating and grammar issues from copy/pasting titles from manwah/manga sites and replace those with the proper capitalization
and punctuation.

## **Features:**
1. **Keybinds**
2. **Random Title Selection:** A button to display a randomly selected title from the list.
3. **Text File Access:** A button to open the text file containing the list.
4. **Automatic Error Corection:** Automatically fixes common formatting and grammer issues<br>
found when copy/pasting titles from manwah/manga sites.

## **Keybinds:**  
- **ENTER:** Submits Title
- **ESC:** Exits the program
