# **Regular Tkinter Reading Tracker**

I really love my reading tracker but I wanted to make it easier to use and more interactive. This is where Tkinter came in, it provides a gui with an input field that will take
titles and once you hit 'ENTER' save it in a list, a button to open the text file itself, and a button to pull a random title out of the list and display it in the GUI.

## Features:
1. Keybinds
2. A button to get a random title
3. A button to open the text file

## Keybinds:  
ENTER = Submits Title
ESC = Exits the program
