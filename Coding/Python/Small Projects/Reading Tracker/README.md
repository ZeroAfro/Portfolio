# **Reading Tracker**

Created to help solve my issue of having hundreds of tabs open of things I wish to read, it will allow you to enter a
title (or anything you want really) and it will then store it in a text file,
it will format the title with brackets to help give better readability.

Users have the option to either enter a single title or enter a 'mass' mode that will allow for faster entry of multiple titles via only requiring the user to enter "y" to return to the title entry portion of the code, users can also delete the whole list, or even view a random title that it returns.
