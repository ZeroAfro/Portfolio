# **Reading Tracker**

Created to help solve my issue of having hundreds of tabs open of things I wish to read, it will allow you to enter a title (or anything you want really) and it will then store it in a text file,
it will format the title with brackets to help give better readability.

Users have the option to either enter a single title or enter a 'mass' mode that will allow for faster entry of multiple titles, users can also delete the whole list, or even view a random title that it returns.
