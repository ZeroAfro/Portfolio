I really liked the concept of my reading list program however I wanted to try my hand at a GUI version and this is it.
Made with tkinker.
The entry field for titles uses the 'ENTER' key to submit them for ease of use and you can exit via the 'X' in the top right or pressing the 'ESC' key.
It must include the txt in the some folder as the program to work as this is the file it stores everything in.
