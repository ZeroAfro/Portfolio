This is my first Python project, I wanted to do something different and the coolest part of coding for me is being able to make something to make my or others life easier.
I do a lot of quizes in books and other places where I either can't or don't want to mark on them and I use to have to make a list to put my answers to these in a text file manually. 
This generates a numbered list based on user input, it will then create a text file with a list of that many lines each formated with periods and a space so its ready for input.
This helped me focus in on how to reearch for answers, troubleshoot, deal with variables, understand while loops, and deal with importing modules to add functionality to my program.
