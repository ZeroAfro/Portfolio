Small overtime calculator as mini project to learn about conditionals and booleans
takes the hours worked and checks to see if its more than or less than 40, if its more than 40 it subtracts 40 from the hours worked and multiplies at by 1.5 to find the amount of overtime pay you are owed
if the hours worked are less than then it tells you that you are not owed any overtime pay and asks if you would like to exit
