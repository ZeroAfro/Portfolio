What drew me most to the field of cyber security was back as a child I was always fascinated with getting into my dad's locked office and I loved computers.
That got me into making batch files, and when I was grounded, they blocked me from the internet by blacklisting my MAC address, so I changed the MAC address, so I was no longer blacklisted.
This solidified my love of not only computers but security, and with my love of both of these things, I naturally came into being interested in cyber security.

My values are important to me, and more core values mirror the values I learned while in AFJROTC in high school and that is:

  "Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do."

Integrity is vital to me and even more so in cyber security because we have so much access to many things that could be confidential or important information.
One must always do the right thing even if no one is watching. I enjoy helping people, and keeping company or people's data safe is one way I see myself doing that.
And I strive for excellence in all I do; if I am doing something, then I strive to give it my very best as to not let myself down or anyone else.
